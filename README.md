This dataset is a collection of real estate listings from San Luis Obispo county, California, and some locations around it from 2009. The prices are their list price at the creation of this dataset.

For this data sets, we want to be able to:

1. load and display the data
2. filter and display the data by one or multiple criteria
3. compute and display basic statistics for subsets of the data
4. create basic visualizations for subsets of data (price histograms for now)
5. fit simple models to explain the relationships between data attributes (linear regression for now)
